# Introduction to Operating Systems

## Virtualization
This is the process where an operating system would take a hardware(think cpu, ssd) and create a version of itself that is intended for human use.
Like websites we visit on a day to day basis, an operating system provides "operations" that allow users to interact with them. The operating system has system calls that can be called to run/access programs/hardware, think of it like the STL library in C++.
