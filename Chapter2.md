# Introduction to Operating Systems

## Virtualization
This is the process where an operating system would take a hardware(think cpu, ssd) and create a version of itself that is intended for human use.
Like websites we visit on a day to day basis, an operating system provides "operations" that allow users to interact with them. An OS has system calls that can be called to run/access programs/hardware, think of it like the STL library in C++. An intuitive way of visualizing OS is an unbreakable while loop that runs forever until ctrl c is pressed by the user.

## Memory
Presented in an array of bytes. To read memory, we specify an address in order to access data stored there; to modify memory, we must also specify the data to be written at a specific address. The process of this is called "virtualizing memory", where each operation has its own address space, meaning a memory space in one program does not have any impact the address spaces in other processes.

## Concurrency
Another way of saying "Doing multiple things at once". The common issues that arise with concurrency is how we execute the code. This will be discussed later, but note that issues with concurrency is that we often times get inaccurate results.

## Persistence
A really easy way to think of it is that you are playing pokemon, but your nintendo switch suddenly runs out of power. However, you didn't save the status, and ultimately all of your hard work goes back to square one. Persistence is the term that referrs to being able to save data persistently (although consistent is a better word, oh well), this is very important in the world of OS because users care a lot about their data.

In our world today, the most common hardware data storages we see are hardrives and SSDs. In an OS, these hardware disks are generally managed by what is called a "file system".
